# Logistic-curvefit-to-the-number-of-COVID-19-cases
During a pandemic the number of cases initially seems to be increasing exponentially but with time the awareness and implemented health institutions catch up resulting in the containment of the pandemic. This leads to the stationary phase of the pandemic where the number of cases are somewhat stable. The exponential function would seem unbecoming during the stable phase. The Logistic function  or the Sigmoid function better encapsulates both the exponential phase and the stable phase of curve in this case the COVID-19 cases in China.
