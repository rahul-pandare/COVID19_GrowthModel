# Logistic Curve Fitting for COVID-19 Case Growth  

## Overview  
This repository implements logistic curve fitting to model the growth of COVID-19 cases over time. During the early phase of a pandemic, case numbers often exhibit **exponential growth**. However, as public awareness, healthcare interventions, and containment measures take effect, the rate of new cases slows, leading to a **stationary phase**.  

A simple **exponential model** fails to account for this saturation effect, making it unsuitable for long-term predictions. Instead, the **logistic function (sigmoid function)** provides a more accurate representation by incorporating both the **exponential growth phase** and the **stabilization phase** observed in epidemiological data.  

## Methodology  
- **Data Source:** COVID-19 case data (e.g., from China).  
- **Curve Fitting:** Utilizes the **logistic function** to fit case growth trends.  
- **Model Characteristics:**  
  - Captures the **initial exponential surge** of infections.  
  - Accounts for **saturation effects** due to interventions and immunity.  
  - Provides a smooth transition between the **growth and stable phases**.  
- **Optimization Technique:** Nonlinear least-squares regression using **SciPy's `curve_fit` function** to estimate parameters.  

## Features  
- Implementation of **logistic curve fitting** for epidemiological modeling.  
- Demonstrates **limitations of exponential models** for long-term pandemic predictions.  
- Uses **Python, NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib** for analysis and visualization.  

## Usage  
1. Ensure Python and required libraries (**NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib**) are installed.  
2. Load COVID-19 case data into the script.  
3. Apply **nonlinear curve fitting** to estimate the logistic model parameters.  
4. Visualize the fitted logistic curve against actual case data.  
5. Modify parameters or apply the method to other regions or datasets.  

## Requirements  
- Python (Recommended: 3.x)  
- NumPy  
- SciPy  
- Matplotlib  

This repository provides a **quantitative approach** to understanding the **growth dynamics of a pandemic** and can be adapted for other infectious diseases or population dynamics.
